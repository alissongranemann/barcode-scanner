    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
    <div>
        <p>This privacy policy applies to the following apps:</p>

        <p>Barcode Scanner</p>

        <p>This policy is required because the CAMERA permissions are used by the app.</p>

        <p>Any data from the camera is used within the app only for the purpose of the app functionality.</p>

        <p>For the Barcode Scanner app, items are scanned through the camera functions, hence the
            android.permission.CAMERA permission.</p>

        <p>We do NOT collect or share any of your Personal information.</p>

        <p>We do NOT collect or share any of your non-Personal information.</p>
